# Matjero Supplier

Supplier Platform for Matjero: the `supplier-api` Go service and the `supplier-web`
React frontend.

This repository depends on [`matjeroapps/core`](https://github.com/matjeroapps/core)
for shared domain logic (commerce, markets), platform packages (auth, config,
database, httpx, i18n, money, observability, outbox/inbox), the actor router, and the
shared OpenAPI primitives. It owns no database migrations — those stay centralized in
`matjeroapps/core` `migrations/`.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/supplier-api` | Supplier HTTP service entrypoint |
| `internal/supplierapi` | Supplier route registration and supplier-only DTOs |
| `internal/openapi` | Supplier OpenAPI document (code-first) |
| `cmd/openapi-gen` | Regenerates `docs/api/supplier/openapi.json` |
| `web/supplier` | Supplier frontend (`@commerce/supplier-web`) |
| `docs/api/supplier` | Generated OpenAPI artifact, committed for drift detection |

## Local Development

```sh
cp .env.example .env
go build ./...
go test ./...
go run ./cmd/openapi-gen && git diff --exit-code -- docs/api
npm install
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test
```

Infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, ZITADEL) is provided by the
`docker-compose.yml` in `matjeroapps/core`.

## Cross-repository dependency

`go.mod` requires `github.com/matjeroapps/core` at a published version. Never
commit a `replace` directive pointing at a local path.

For side-by-side development, use a Go workspace file kept **outside** both
repositories (for example in their shared parent directory):

```sh
go work init ./core ./supplier
```

`go.work` and `go.work.sum` are git-ignored so they can never be committed.
